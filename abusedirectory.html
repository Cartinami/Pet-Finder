    <h3 class="statement">How To Prevent Animal Abuse</h3>
    <p id="prevention">It's easier to recognize physical abuse when you see something cruel like choking, setting tails on fire, dunking heads under water, kicking and hitting. If you see such a thing, you'll probably be outraged and want to confront the abuser. Avoid that impulse. If you can safely take photos or video of the incident, do so. This firm evidence is invaluable to investigators. Note what you witness in as much detail as possible and provide investigators with everything (i.e. what the abuser looks like and what he/she was wearing, where the animal is located, etc.) In the case of a child abusing an animal, the parent may be unaware of the behavior. But because animal abuse has been linked with other types of abuse in the home -- namely child abuse -- it's better to let the authorities investigate
